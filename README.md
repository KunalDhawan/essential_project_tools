# essential_project_tools

The aim of this respository is to consolidate materials for all essential tools that are used in the lifecycle of any project. This includes links to amazing documentations/tutorials for each of the tools and also a dummy self project to demonstrate their use. A big shout out to my colleagues at Jio AI CoE - Hemant Kashniyal and Naveen Pandey for this amazing bootcamp initiative.
